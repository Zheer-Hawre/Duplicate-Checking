## How To Use
I created this program for a client working at a travel agency. When booking tickets, he was manually entering each passport number into an Excel file to document them. He also had a system that saved every passport number he entered. To verify that he hadn't missed any entries, or he hadn't entered any entries twice he was printing both Excel files and manually comparing them. This automation allows him to:

Identify any passport numbers in the first Excel file that don’t exist in the second, alerting him if any passports are missing from the system.
Find passport numbers in the second Excel file that aren’t in the first, in case any were entered by mistake.
Detect duplicates in either file, helping prevent accidental double bookings and potential losses.
